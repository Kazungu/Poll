'''request.POST is a dictionary-like object that lets you access submitted data by key name. In this case, 
request.POST['choice'] returns the ID of the selected choice, as a string. request.POST values are always strings. 

Note that Django also provides request.GET for accessing GET data in the same way – 
but we’re explicitly using request.POST in our code, to ensure that data is only altered via a POST call.

request.POST['choice'] will raise KeyError if choice wasn’t provided in POST data. 
The above code checks for KeyError and redisplays the question form with an error message if choice isn’t given.

After incrementing the choice count, the code returns an HttpResponseRedirect rather than a normal HttpResponse. 
HttpResponseRedirect takes a single argument: 
the URL to which the user will be redirected (see the following point for how we construct the URL in this case).

As the Python comment above points out, you should always return an HttpResponseRedirect after successfully dealing 
with POST data. This tip isn’t specific to Django; it’s good Web development practice in general. 

We are using the reverse() function in the HttpResponseRedirect constructor in this example. This function helps 
avoid having to hardcode a URL in the view function. It is given the name of the view that we want to pass control to 
and the variable portion of the URL pattern that points to that view. In this case, using the URLconf we set up in 
Tutorial 3, this reverse() call will return a string like 

'/polls/3/results/' where the 3 is the value of question.id. This redirected URL will then call the 'results' view to 
display the final page. '''
